The Meta Wearables Device Access Toolkit enables developers to utilize Meta's AI glasses to build hands-free wearable experiences into their mobile applications.
By integrating this SDK, developers can reliably connect to Meta's AI glasses and leverage capabilities like video streaming and photo capture.

The Wearables Device Access Toolkit is in developer preview.
Developers can access our SDK and documentation, test on supported AI glasses, and create organizations and release channels to share with test users.

### Opting out of data collection

To configure analytics settings in your Meta Wearables DAT iOS app, you can modify your app's `Info.plist` file using either of these two methods:

**Method 1:** Using Xcode (Recommended)

1. In Xcode, select your app target in the **Project** navigator
1. Go to the **Info** tab
1. Navigate to **Custom iOS Target Properties**  and find the `MWDAT` key
1. Add a new key under `MWDAT` called `Analytics` of type `Dictionary`
1. Add a new key to the `Analytics` dictionary called `OptOut` of type `Boolean` and set the value to `YES`

**Method 2:** Direct XML editing

Add or modify the following in your `Info.plist` file.

```XML
<key>MWDAT</key>
<dict>
    <key>Analytics</key>
    <dict>
        <key>OptOut</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
</dict>
```

**Default behavior:** If the `OptOut` key is missing or set to `NO`/`<false/>`, analytics are enabled
(i.e., you are **not** opting out). Set to `YES`/`<true/>` to disable data collection.

**Note:** In other words, this setting controls whether or not you're opting out of analytics:

- `YES`/`<true/>` = Opt out (analytics **disabled**)
- `NO`/`<false/>` = Opt in (analytics **enabled**)
